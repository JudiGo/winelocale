 INFORMATION

 Mysteriously, the Wine project has always ignored the needs of international
 users, instead focusing on how to squeeze more frames per second out of
 [Game of the Year Here]. However, for those of us needing general
 application support, we've been left mostly to our own devices.
 
 The Wine mailing lists only say to change the LANG environment variable to
 switch the language Wine runs in. That's all good and fine, but it does
 nothing to solve the massive font problems involved in running Windows in
 other locales.
 
 The solution to this problem is WineLocale, a PHP-GTK powered script which
 can act like AppLocale by Microsoft. It allows you to launch an application
 in any locale you want with all fonts in tact. The only question left is
 whether or not Wine even supports your application.
 
 WineLocale can also export shell scripts to automatically launch the
 application in the desired locale. These are stored to ~/.local/bin, so you
 will need to add this to your PATH environment variable.

 INSTALL

 Install the package using your choice of dpkg, gdebi or my favorite: the
 double click.

 LICENSE

 The original WineLocale shell script (WineLocale0) was released under the
 GNU GPL. The PHP rewrite has been developed under the BSD License. As the
 original was written in DASH script and this implementation is in PHP, it
 would be hard to claim it shares any code with the original.
 
 If you must have a GPL-based WineLocale, please go to the archive and get
 the final release of WineLocale0. You are free to modify it in any way you
 so choose, and even to fork it to a new project. This line is terminated,
 and I will only maintain WineLocale1.
